# So why a Bootcamp?

If you've had a look at some of my previous projects, you might be wondering why I'd want to do a Coding Bootcamp. After all I've written complex software including webapps before to a standard I got paid for. The issue is that all of my years of knowledge are self-taught to solve specific problems, and just never left me with a general employable skillset, at least so far as I'm concerned. I also have a massive problem with Impostor Syndrome - I'm always assuming that I'm the dumbest bag of rocks in the room and although I've done plenty of real-world coding projects, it's not been enough to convince myself that I could seriously apply for a coding job, which is why I haven't in a decade. Coupled with being unemployed courtesy of Covid and a neck injury that's causing me a lot of pain, I needed to change things up a bit.

That's the idea behind me going for a bootcamp - to consolidate my hacky skillset into something useful and employable, and convince myself that I'm actually worth employing as a developer.

# Week 1

## Git

First up was git. I've been using this for a while on and off for various projects, but a refresher is never a bad thing, particularly when we worked as a pair to issue push and pull requests. As a solo developer for all my previous projects working with people on development work is a huge blindspot for me, so it was nice to work with someone else right from the get-go. This was perhaps something missing from the rest of the days this week, although I can understand that the tutors need everyone individually to get to a certain place in the first week.

## JS Day 1

Much as Git is useful, it doesn't give quite the same buzz as successfully solving coding problems, however simplistic, with a programming language. Having written some fairly complex full stack apps with JavaScript I didn't find the exercises particularly challenging, but I used the spare time to not just find _a_ solution, but a _good_ solution.

For example, I found a neater way of using a ternary statement to either add a key or increment a value assigned to a key in an object, making my code more succinct for this sort of problem. When I had extra time I worked on the FreeCodeCamp Front-End Frameworks course, both learning and applying new knowledge there too.

## JS Day 2

Having had a good chunk of experience with ES6 I quite enjoyed the exercises on arrays - for almost every coding problem there's a `map`, `reduce`, `every` or `sort` that can break the problem down.

On this day I discovered `Array.prototype.every()` as a really neat way of checking that all elements in an array met a certain criteria, a problem I would previously have resorted to some iffy method chaining or a clunky `if` statement.

## JS Day 3

First up on this day was array methods...yeah beat you to it on that one Northcoders...but the exercises showed me that sometimes the prettiest solution was the best or most performant.

For example, in one exercise I'd built a lookup object to count the occurrences of letters in a sentence. It worked, it passed all the tests, but as the actual exercise just wanted to know if there were no repeated letters in the passed string, meaning I could have just compared the first and last instances of a particular character and returned prematurely if I found any mismatches.

This day was also my birthday. Felt a bit awkward mentioning it, and I didn't want to make a fuss, but that's a commentary on my social awkwardness rather than anyone or anything to do with the course.

## HTML and CSS

I could see my girlfriend really liking our tutor for HTML and CSS with her fairy VS Code theme, and much as HTML particularly isn't the most challenging subject it was really handy to go over the absolute basics again, including when and how to use the HTML5 semantic elements which I was still a bit fuzzy on.

Moving on to CSS, I continued to push myself and try to finally get my head around justify versus align in CSS grid, which I managed to put to use to create a half decent looking layout.

Also, I suck at Sketchful.

# So how was Week 1?

In terms of difficulty, this was definitely an 'intro week' for me; nothing was too taxing, but I enjoyed batting through the exercises and applying any odd new tidbits of knowledge or code to my work on the third FreeCodeCamp qualification, Front-End Frameworks, which I now only have one project left to complete on.

The group and tutors seem to be an interesting and friendly bunch of people, and I'm definitely more confident about actually going in to the Leeds branch of Northcoders at some point to meet face to face.

# Week 2 Ahead

This will the be the first week of Backend I believe, and this is probably where I've got the least recent experience.
