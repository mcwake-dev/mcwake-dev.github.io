# Introduction
I've been coding on and off for quite a long time. As a schoolchild I toyed with the venerable QBasic (the one that came with implementations of Gorillas and Snake), learned Pascal and a bit of C++ in college, then did C, Java, C#, and more Java in university. Post-degree I taught myself the Groovy JRE language, then ultimately very early 0.something Node.js, which I developed a training course and my most recent major project with, sidetracked occasionally by the horror that is VBA.

Throughout that span of...oh dear...twenty odd years(!!!) I've always been trying to solve a problem, usually a problem which was causing others issues, for example during my time at UKVI where managers were constantly blaming staff for being too slow, while simultaneously managing workload in the least efficient way possible.

# So what's the problem?
The problem there is that much of the time I was so busy working out *how* to solve a problem, that I often spent little time working out *why* a coded solution was better. This led me down the garden path a bit when developing some solutions, such as my VLE system which was complex and unworkable without my intervention. Indeed, I got to see what it must have been like for my successors at the university when working for UKVI and trying to unpick a visa application streaming tool of fantastic complexity made by a former UKVI worker.

# Reflections
That's why blogging is a good idea,  making sure I reflect on the problems I have solved, without that time pressure to simply get something working by any means necessary. That's how I'll get not just a solution that works, but one that is actually the best solution. Or at least an improvement on what came before!
