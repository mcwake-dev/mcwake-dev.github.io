# Introduction
Around a year ago I had a crack at much of FreeCodeCamp's first two sections, Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. The first was pretty simple, but the latter got progressively more complex until I eventually came to a grinding halt and moved to following other tutorials. However I rationalised it by working on other things, ultimately I made a mistake.
<br />
Today, I rectified that mistake:

# So What Changed?
Between last year and this year, my JavaScript knowledge is fairly similar. I might know a few extra tricks for dealing with rounding errors, a couple of new Array methods like `every()`, but the difference is mindset. I don't see the inability to solve a particular problem in 57 seconds as a personal failure anymore, or proof of my 'imposter syndrome' - it's just something I need to maybe take a step back from, or approach a different way.

A great soundtrack helps. I recommend the following for difficult problems:
