Hand code every stylesheet, write every library. Any less feels like cheating. But ultimately purpose of this blog is not to demonstrate that I can write a blog engine. In fact, anyone with about five minutes and Google can find a tutorial for writing a blog engine. This isn't 2002, a blog isn't that impressive or exciting to anyone who might want to hire me.</p><p>What needs to be impressive or exciting isn't my blog, but what I write about on it. So I'd much rather focus my efforts on adding peer to peer audio and video to my group project, or trying out the antithesis of all current front-end frameworks, htmx.org. Or I can endlessly tweak some CSS and demonstrate I can do basic MVC with Express...which I already have a project for!</p><p>So, I will discard my guilt at using Publii to write my blog, and get on with doing something interesting for both writer and reader alike!</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 11, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://mcwake-dev.github.io/authors/matthew-c-wake/" class="invert" rel="author">Matthew C Wake</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://mcwake-dev.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
