# Matthew C Wake's Portfolio Webapp
This portfolio is intended to provide a place for me to showcase coding projects I have worked on or contributed to. Additionally it contains a blog where I will discuss the current problems I am working on or new knowledge I have gained.

The live version is running on Vercel at: [https://mcwake-portfolio.vercel.app](https://mcwake-portfolio.vercel.app).

## Running Locally
Should you wish to run this app locally, you will need the following:
* Node.js 16.9.0 or above
* NPM 7.24.0 or above
* Next.js installed locally (not strictly required but can help)

After installing the above, you can clone, initialise and run the app by using the following commands in order:

```
git clone https://github.com/mcwake-dev/mcwake-dev.github.io
cd mcwake-dev.github.io
npm i
npm run dev
```
