                        A garage door company signed up to a new cloud-based workflow monitoring system,
                        <a
                            href="https://www.bigchange.com/job-management-software/?utm_term=bigchange%20jobwatch&utm_campaign=Google+Search+-+Targeted+Landing+Pages+-+Brand&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=5747945595&hsa_cam=10646147484&hsa_grp=104820513493&hsa_ad=457075242124&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-932056260417&hsa_kw=bigchange%20jobwatch&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwnJaKBhDgARIsAHmvz6cU_DNF0hZmK2sgkXdqUJOKZkuP4Zs8DbOXif7apNcPQMbFW9DtGnoaAm03EALw_wcB">
                            BigChange JobWatch</a>.
                        But instead of replacing an error-prone and unwieldy paper-based system, more errors cropped up
                        everywhere, leaving customers and staff in the dark about their garage doors, which sometimes
                        had
                        not even been ordered on the supposed fitting date. As complaints mounted, I stepped in to try
                        and solve the problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Investigating, the biggest problem was in the way data was presented in the system. Creating
                        jobs,
                        having jobs of different types (e.g. surveys, fitting, repairs) and flagging jobs (such as those
                        where the new garage door or a part had yet to be ordered, or had been received) was not the
                        issue -
                        the issue was that there was no way to view this information at a glance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using the APIs available in the cloud system, I extracted the job data using a Node.js
                        application into
                        a MongoDB Atlas instance, polling the current day's jobs regularly for a live view and doing a
                        single overnight
                        bulk query to update older jobs, then used the flexibility of having my own datastore as a
                        platform to query the data in new ways not supported by the BigChange JobWatch platform, and
                        without
                        risking the stability of the BigChange platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I developed, with regular feedback from staff, a new dashboard which showed the current location
                        of
                        all remote workers, the current status of jobs on the current day, including job type and any
                        relevant
                        flags, coupled with an email reporting system which would flag up jobs where an error could be
                        in the making,
                        such as arranging a fitting date for a garage door which had yet to be delivered from the
                        manufacturer.
                    </p>

                    complaints were drastically reduced and potential errors were averted without the customer ever
                    knowing there
                    had been a problem. My dashboard was deployed in four offices to help with managing over 30 remote staff.
